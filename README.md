Some of the recommendations  :

Millennials are becoming increasingly fascinated with energy drinks. Aggressive marketing activities, primarily targeted at young people, are the leading cause of its popularity. Additionally, energy drink marketing claims to energize the body, sharpen the mind, and improve performance and stamina, attracting more customers. The increasing occurrence of social gatherings are driving Indian youngsters towards consuming energy drinks, which are primarily classified as non-alcoholic, caffeinated, and sports drinks. Thus, Codex should focus on the young generation between the age group of 15-30 years.

Compact and portable cans should be used by CodeX as these are convenient and lightweight. Being absolutely airtight  cans allow beverages to stay fresh for longer.  These are ideal for travelling purposes as they have a low risk of leaking or tearing during transportation. Thus, it can attract the premium customers . Introducing innovative pet bottle designs  at a lower price  for targeting medium and lower segments could lead to reach broader market area and would cater to diverse packaging styles.

Price and demand have a inverse relationship. Higher the price , demand will decrease. As CodeX is new in market so it should adopt low pricing strategy( A pricing strategy in which a company offers a relatively low price to stimulate demand and gain market share). Introducing 250 ml cans priced between 50-99 units and  a small variant of 100 ml pet bottles priced below 50 units would cater to  large customer base and to increase brand awareness.
